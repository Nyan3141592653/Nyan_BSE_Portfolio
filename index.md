My intensive project is the Hexapod. I chose it because it looked really cool, and I can actually use and make modifications to it instead of leaving it in the closet to collect dust. It is made of 18 servos, a WLAN module, <!--a wireless module-->, an Arduino Mega v3 board, and Acrylic plates. The servo motors are the components that make the robot move The WLAN module, which stands for wireless local area network, is used to connect the computer or phone wirelessly to the hexapod but my computer’s software isn’t compatible with the WLAN to connect. <!--The wireless module is used to connect the controller to the robot--> The Arduino Mega board connects all of these components, and it is charged by a rechargeable battery. The acrylic plates make up the structure of the Hexapod. While building this I faced many challenges. Most of them revolved around the screws because the holes the screws were supposed to go in didn't have threading 
so I had to use quite a bit of force to screw them in. Also, a few servos kept overheating so I had to replace them. The software also gave me a hard time when I was calibrating it because the legs would not move, but I restarted the program and reset the servos and that worked. For my next milestone, I will have the controller built and connected to the Hexapod.


# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25WGWYHx3E4?start=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My starter project was the useless machine. It had a pressure switch, a flip switch, an acrylic arm, a motor, a battery console, an LED, a PCV board, and the acrylic plates that assemble the box itself. When the switch is flipped the electrical current travels to the motor and the arm moves up, this releases the pressure switch telling the LED to turn on. The arm then flips the switch back creating another electrical current to the motor that tells the arm to come back, the arm goes back into the box and it presses the pressure switch which turns off the LED. The electrical currents all traveled through the PCV board. It is powered by three triple-A batteries. I enjoyed soldering the parts together, but I had some difficulties with the switch as I accidentally soldered it a little slanted this was a problem because when I tested it the arm would miss the switch entirely. Instead of de-soldering the whole switch, I changed the spacer placement between the arm and the motor, and that worked. My next project is the Hexapod.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components. 
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
