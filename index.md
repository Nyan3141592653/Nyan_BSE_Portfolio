The Hexapod is a robotic creature designed with six legs that mimic the walking motion of insects. It is a versatile and programmable robot that allows me to build and customize my own Hexapod robot. The Hexapod's body is made of high-quality acrylic material, providing durability and sturdiness. Each leg consists of three servo motors, allowing for precise control of movement. The Hexapod is powered by an Arduino board, which serves as the brain of the robot, controlling its actions and receiving input from sensors. It features a wireless control mode, enabling users to control the Hexapod remotely via a smartphone or computer. It also has a controller that is also powered by an Arduino board. The Hexapod offers an engaging and educational platform for learning about robotics and exploring the fascinating world of engineering.

My second milestone for the hexapod is building the controller. It is made from a custom Arduino Uno, a Remote shield, a wireless module, a 9-volt battery, and an acrylic plate. The custom Arduino Uno is used to program the Remote Shield. The Remote shield, which is on top of the Arduino, is used to control the Hexapod. There are two wireless modules, one on the controller and one on the robot; this is what lets me control the Hexapod wirelessly because the frequencies released from the wireless module are the same. The acrylic plate is used to hold the battery and the boards together. When both the Hexapod and the controller are turned on the frequencies from the wireless modules connect and so are the controller and hexapod. Then you can move the joystick and that sends a message to the wireless module which outs in on a frequency wave over to the other wireless module. That then sends the messae to the Arduino on the Hexapod and the motion you wanted by moving the joystick then occurs. A challenge I faced while building this was downloading the software because the Arduino IDE app didn’t detect my USB type C as a port, so I had to restart my computer, and that worked. So far what has been surprising about the project is how quickly I built it, in a week, which opens a very wide variety of what  I could do next with modifications. My next steps are to add the modifications. I chose to add an LCD to display different messages or maybe computer-generated messages if I can figure out the coding. I'll also add a LED matrix to display a face that could change, again, depending on if I can figure out the code.

My intensive project is the Hexapod. I chose it because it looked really cool, and I can actually use and make modifications to it instead of leaving it in the closet to collect dust. It is made of 18 servos, a WLAN module, <!--a wireless module-->, an Arduino Mega v3 board, and Acrylic plates. The servo motors are the components that make the robot move The WLAN module, which stands for wireless local area network, is used to connect the computer or phone wirelessly to the hexapod but my computer’s software isn’t compatible with the WLAN to connect. <!--The wireless module is used to connect the controller to the robot--> The Arduino Mega board connects all of these components, and it is charged by a rechargeable battery. The acrylic plates make up the structure of the Hexapod. While building this I faced many challenges. Most of them revolved around the screws because the holes the screws were supposed to go in didn't have threading 
so I had to use quite a bit of force to screw them in. Also, a few servos kept overheating so I had to replace them. The software also gave me a hard time when I was calibrating it because the legs would not move, but I restarted the program and reset the servos and that worked. For my next milestone, I will have the controller built and connected to the Hexapod.


# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25WGWYHx3E4?start=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My starter project was the useless machine. It had a pressure switch, a flip switch, an acrylic arm, a motor, a battery console, an LED, a PCV board, and the acrylic plates that assemble the box itself. When the switch is flipped the electrical current travels to the motor and the arm moves up, this releases the pressure switch telling the LED to turn on. The arm then flips the switch back creating another electrical current to the motor that tells the arm to come back, the arm goes back into the box and it presses the pressure switch which turns off the LED. The electrical currents all traveled through the PCV board. It is powered by three triple-A batteries. I enjoyed soldering the parts together, but I had some difficulties with the switch as I accidentally soldered it a little slanted this was a problem because when I tested it the arm would miss the switch entirely. Instead of de-soldering the whole switch, I changed the spacer placement between the arm and the motor, and that worked. My next project is the Hexapod.

Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs.
